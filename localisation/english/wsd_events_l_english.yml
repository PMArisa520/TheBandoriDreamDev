 wsd_event.1.d:0 "In the ongoing stalemate of the Japanese Civil War's Tokyo theater, an attack targeting civilians erupted a few days ago. As the Western Army's vanguard broke through the Tokyo Self-Defense Force's defenses, unidentified long-range fire mistakenly identified the Aine metal sculpture outside the Bushido headquarters as an armored unit, continuously shelling it for 17 minutes. This resulted in the deaths of several civilians, including Takaaki Kitani, Hirotada Ichimoto, and Ayano Unicorn.\n\nThis 94mm thick sculpture is actually the personal emblem of Aine, the leader of the Osaka region, known for its sharp angles.\n\n\"This is a blatant provocation by the Tokyo rebels against General Aine! Their casualties inflicted on civilians constitute a war crime.\" A spokesman for the Osaka frontline army claimed at the bombing site that the bombing was caused by the Tokyo Self-Defense Force rebels. The Self-Defense Force commander, however, stated that the Kansai rebel staff should update their optical identification manual and not waste valuable howitzer shells on flat reflective metal instead of armor.\n\nAccording to frontline soldiers, the sculpture may have been attacked because its metal surface in the morning mist created a visual effect that confused it with an armored target.\n\nFortunately, the sculpture remained largely intact after the prolonged shelling, which was considered a miracle by the Kansai side. Affected by this,"

 sk_japan.69.desc:0 "A joint investigation by Reuters and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung revealed systemic behavioral misconduct within the five-person core of the New Japan ruling group (POPIPA Group). According to the testimonies of 12 anonymous officials and leaked official residence itineraries, after their routine 'policy coordination meetings' every Wednesday, the group would invariably hold 'overnight special meetings' in the basement of the Prime Minister's residence, which the Japanese public refers to as 'Small Office'. Security personnel confirmed that large quantities of damaged clothing and adult products were often cleaned up from the scene, and the Ministry of Finance unusually added 'furniture replacement subsidies' for three consecutive months. Doujinshi depicting the intimate interactions of the five have long been circulating in the Tokyo underground market, while the Chief Cabinet Secretary declined to comment."

Whenever she played it, the strings would emit inspiring sound waves that could boost public morale.\n\nWith this mysterious guitar, Kasumi successfully launched an uprising in Tokyo and became the leader of the uprising army. She led a guerrilla force composed of students and music lovers, and through a series of lightning campaigns, captured strategic locations such as the Tokyo Tower, the National Diet Building, and the Imperial Palace, soon controlling Japan and its surrounding areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the AHG army led by Sachiko Toyokawa, the legitimate prime minister before the civil war, approached Tokyo from Osaka.\n\nSachiko Toyokawa proposed that after the Emperor voluntarily abdicates, Kasumi Toyama would temporarily act as the head of state to unify command and form a united government."
